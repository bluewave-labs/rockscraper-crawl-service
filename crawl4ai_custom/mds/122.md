Shipped and arrived on time. Packaging was literally some of the best I've ever
seen from a non corporate seller. No exaggeration. Very well protected in an
appropriate sized box with plenty of packing material. Games were as described
in very good shape. The manuals and spines are near perfect,some slight age
wear/scratches to the cases and inserts,but the discs are absolutely immaculate.
They look brand new. Also a great deal for games this complete and clean.
Perfect Seller,will buy again!

envelope. Much appreciated excellent seller!
