PSP came in perfect condition, no yellowing in the controls and minimal
scratches that are barely noticable. It's been updated to the latest software
and everything works perfectly. Shipped the same day I bought it which was
pretty awesome. Love the pink color and the price was decent for a console that
looks practically new.

Console arrived quickly and in great working condition. There was some dirt on
the buttons and analog stick, but these spots were shown in the pictures for the
product’s listing. The included battery also works great. There are no issues
with the screen as well. Incredibly happy with my purchase!

i love it!! Came way earlier than said (which is good). I’m struggling with
getting internet connection though, but the games I have can be played without
it so it’s not a big deal for me - nor is this an issue that has to do with the
seller. It works perfectly fine and has no noticeable scratches. I also found
the color really pretty!

Arrived quick, easy, no problem. Works great and in good shape. Could probably
mention in the description that all of this model are Japanese (rather than "may
or may not be Japanese"), but I don't think that's a big deal. Thank you!

I received the PSP in pretty good condition and I am happy with the overall
product. The price for value was awesome at only $119 it can’t really be beat.
There were not to many scratches or anything on a console 20 years old so
appearance wise it was pretty good. The only issue I had was a few stuck pixels
that were red but I got in touch with the seller and they were fantastic to work
with offering many options for helping me solve my problem. Overall the quality
or the product was pretty good

Shipped and arrived on time. Works great! Only a little scratching and looks
almost new. However there was some sort of hard residue that I had to scrape off
myself but it didn’t affect the psp thankfully. Overall really happy with my
order! Definitely recommend buying.

The Joy Cons arrived in perfect as new condition just as advertised. These are
OEM refurb Joy Cons and are in perfect OEM quality just minus the OEM packaging.
If you don't care about the original boxes these are a great value over buying
new. They shipped next day and if it weren't for USPS misrouting my package all
the way across the country they would have arrived just 3 days after ordering.

Wow, I am very impressed with the process I had while purchasing this. The
seller immediately shipped out the product, as detailed (and actually better
than that). The seller was prompt, efficient, and packaged my PSP efficiently.
The quality that went into packaging and shipping the PSP were excellent, too.
The appearance of the device is also quite remarkable, as it looks like it was
hardly used (if at all). The price that I paid was good, too.

The console arrived quickly and as described. The console was very well
packaged. There are a few scratches on the bottom screen as well as quite a few
minor cracks on the top case of the console (which may have occurred during
shipping, I’m not sure) but it looks almost brand new otherwise! The console
itself takes a long time to turn on but it still works as intended. Overall,
this is a really great seller and I definitely recommend purchasing from them.

I recently purchased a PSP 3000 from The Gaming Archive, and I couldn't be
happier with my choice! The PSP arrived in excellent condition, complete with a
new battery and charger, just as advertised. The shipping was impressively fast,
which is always a major plus, and the packaging was secure. As a first-time PSP
owner, I learned that a memory stick duo (SD card for the PSP) is necessary, so
keep that in mind. Overall, my experience has been fantastic, and I recommend
shopping with TGA

I asked a question before I bought these and the seller got back to me pretty
quickly. I went ahead and bought a pair and they arrived way faster than I
expected. They were packed well and looked brand new. I'm super happy with my
new Joy Cons, and they're so nice in white. Would totally buy from this seller
again. 10/10
