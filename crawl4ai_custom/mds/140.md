The controller arrived in perfect condition, the shipping was good and fast, the
quality of the controller is very good for the price. The buttons feel good
quality, not like the original but quite good. The seller is attentive and
informative, notifying in advance if there would be delays or not in shipping.
Good experience. I would definitely buy from the same store again in the future.

Item shipped in a bag unprotected, crushed in transit, auction does not state
colors vary, only black pic'd, I rec'd white, requested return, instead of the
courtesy of accepting return and providing return shipping label asap, as most
sellers do, they harassed me with messages, trying to coax me into keeping a
color I did not order, offering partial refunds, ignoring return request, I did
not receive refund until last day in which ebay steps in. Terrible/ stressful/
negative buying experience.
