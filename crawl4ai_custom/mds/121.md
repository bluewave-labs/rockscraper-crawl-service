Received my Gamecube much sooner than expected! In great condition, exactly like
in the photo, and works perfectly. The violet plastic looks great, hasn't faded
or degraded at all. Even got some cool Japanese supermarket ads as packing
material!

Beautiful purple game cube. Came with all proper cables (controller + game
card). Functioned perfectly with my North American region games. It’s in great
condition and was listed at a great price. If your looking for a GameCube for
nostalgia, video game preservation or as a backup; this is a great place :)

The Gamecube arrived as described and in working order "so far". Quality is
decent keeping in mind its a used console and so is the appearance. The value
was a little higher that other selling of the same product, but I have tried
other and cancelled two order due to lack of communication or wrong
descriptions. Recommended.

The GameCube was in GREAT shape!! I am very happy, it was clean and in
surprisingly good shape for an older system. It made me so happy, I finally got
an orange one! All three controllers worked great, the memory card was perfect!
I couldn’t be happier with my purchase, I think it was definitely worth the
money!

This is great!! I bought the orange console with cables and a 59-block memory
card. It is all in pristine condition! Factory reset and everything! If you want
a GameCube for cheap, BUY THIS! It's perfect, I love it! The orange is so
vibrant! This is like new! I can't believe I got this for $104 only! Everywhere
else says $150 or more!

The GameCube works great, and was packaged really securely with lots of bubble
wrap around each of the components. Everything was included and the seller kept
me updated on how the order was going leading up to shipping it. The violet
GameCube I got was a bit discolored, but the description warned about that, so
that's not a problem.
