I initially received a dirty and malfunctioning console, but the seller was
quick to reply and sent me a new console that worked perfectly. The item was
packaged great and the console itself and controllers are in very good
condition. My only minor nitpicks is that the delivery time took a bit (USPS's
fault, not the seller) and the HDMI cable that came with the console was
slightly corroded. Other than that, highly recommend and would purchase from
again!

Okay seller. Console is not in Excellent condition as it has dings and scratches
on it. One controller doesn’t hold a charge. Do yourself a favor and get OEM
controllers. Packaging was very good and shipping was fast.

The PlayStation showed up quickly with all the parts promised individually
packed as though someone took their time, not just throwing everything in the
box. It looks brand new and works perfectly. You can tell someone went over this
and cleaned it thoroughly. It looks brand new.

Everything came in absolutely IMPECABLE condition! So so clean, and they even
gave me a nice new third party controller in my bundle! It all came in nice
packaging and all felt like I was practically getting a new console. Everything
smelt nice and clean/new too which is SO important for getting a 2nd hand
console. 10/10 would defiantly buy from these guys again! Thanks so much.

Described if not a little better then described condition wise; Controllers for
non-oem feel nice to the touch with some slight discomfort over the joysticks
but its managable. Overall running of the console is smooth and just as good as
I remember when I was a teen.

Console came in really great condition, not to mention the console being wrapped
up and shipped nicely. Console looks like new as if it was never even unboxed!
Plays well.

the seller and they immediately took care of me, and not even 3 days later I
received a replacement in the mail. They are exactly as described, they're good
quality for the price and the look and feel are awesome. I would recommend this
seller to everyone. Thank you for the excellent customer service!

I would buy from them with no problem, I have hooked it up and played a game on
it and so far no issues. BUY ONE FROM THEM.!!
