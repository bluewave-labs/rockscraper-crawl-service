Ok. I‚Äôm old. This arrived and pretty easy to figure out. But the reason I‚Äôm
recommending this retro hand console over all the others is the support. The
seller answered all my questions no matter how dumb. And immediately. Dreamlab
inc is incredible, awesome, professional, friendly, and knowledgeable in their
products. The console arrived quickly, packaged well. The console has that new
car smell. It is high quality in construction and software. It‚Äôs a great price
for 10k games. Buy one.
