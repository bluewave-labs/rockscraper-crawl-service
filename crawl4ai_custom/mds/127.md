My ice blue ds lite came right on time very quickly after I ordered it and it’s
in near pristine condition! I highly recommend this seller this console is
perfect for reliving my old childhood memories and I can’t wait to play it! Both
the ds and gameboy slots works with every game I’ve tried and it came well
packaged with a charger, matching stylus and gb slot cover.

Got here quick. In working condition. It turned on and played my copy of Pokemon
Emerald just fine. The DS is in great cosmetic condition. The only thing that
would seem to be a bit of a miss is the yellow tint to the screens but that is
normal with age on these. Overall, would do business with again.

+ Functional and runs ds games without issue + Good Condition for a used DS - Top and bottom screen use different screen types. Top has a cool tint while the bottom screen has a yellow/warm tint. Distracting. - Charger & charging port not flush when plugged in - Small Dirt visible under the clear outer shell of the case. Cannot be cleaned without disassembling. - Strange serial number printed onto case It’ll get the job done, but there’s a noticeable quality diff compared to my og ds.

This DS came right on time, quality of the body was great and the screens were
perfect. Slot for the GBA cover seemed new alongside the stylus which was
matching the color of the console. Worth the price, also to add this DS came in
great packing and the charger for it seems brand new. If your like me and youve
either never had a DS before or youre looking to relive some old memories, this
seller is worth it for sure. I look forward to future purchases if they end up
selling other handheld.
