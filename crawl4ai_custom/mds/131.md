Everything came as advertised and I’m extremely satisfied. Although one
controller and the GameCube did have very little smudges on them, nothing
serious some wipes won’t fix. Reasonably priced as well, my local retro game
stores had a GameCube and 2 controllers costing almost double. 10/10 recommend
this seller. They also offer a one month warrantee which is a great plus.

Perfect condition, I’m so happy to have this. The price was small considering
how much my wife will flip when she opens this. The GameCube is clean and I
didn’t see at kind of blemishes or damage to its appearance.

Item came 99% as described. Only problem is the CMOS battery in the Nintendo
Gamecube they sent me is dead. The only issue that causes though is the process
of having to set the date and time every time the console is unplugged and
plugged back in. Disc drive works great, controller, memory card, power and AV
cables included work great. Overall mostly positive experience.
