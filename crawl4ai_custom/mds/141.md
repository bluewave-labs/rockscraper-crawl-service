Got an A-rank device. It’s working exactly as expected for the most part. Only
had it for a couple of days. Great condition just as described. Couple of nicks
but nothing crazy especially for the price. The screen looks brand new though.
Also no box which was great for me but not for collectors. Would highly
recommend to anyone that just wants a switch lite who already has a main switch.

I ordered the Nintendo Switch Lite (s-tier condition) and it's great! It arrived
in just a couple days and it's in excellent condition, as described as the
seller (the screen has zero scratches, and the buttons work as new). I had to
change the language to English and region to Americas, but I was able to do that
quite easily with a quick search online. Overall very happy with the unit!

The condition is amazing!! It came really fast and I honestly thought it would
take longer. It’s worth every penny. I did get A rank but it looks brand new, no
scratches and clean. It runs well but the e shop is a bit slower than the newer
version. But it’s so pretty and it’s lovely to have

SUPER GOOD QUALITY. I expected it to be like all scratched up since it was a C
Grade but IT LOOKED SO NEW. The standards of this seller on their items is
perfect and buying my nintendo from them was worth every single penny. There was
some marking on the back and on the corner if the front of like marker or smth?
But it’s hardly noticeable, especially if u buy like a case for it or something.
Overall its perfect and I would buy again!

Shipping was extremely fast! The 2DS arrived safely and well packaged. It works
wonderfully so far. The item came in the exact condition as described. There
were just a few very light scratches as mentioned in the description but none
that affect the functionality. You cant even see it in the photos I took. It was
basically brand new other than that which was impressive for the price. Overall
wonderful experience from this seller.

Perfectly as described. The package was delivered within two days of me buying

recommend this seller, especially if you are looking for quick shipping and
attention to detail.
