Smooth transaction, fast shipping. Item arrived in great shape and in working
order. Now for the nuts and bolts: Ordered a total of 3 over a 2 month span.
First 2 were arkOs and were a legit r36s. Excellent construction and the memory
card was branded. Very pleased! The 3rd one was ordered a few weeks later and
was running EmuElec and had OS on chip. Very slow, obvious clone. Contacted
seller for possible return. Day 2, no response but decided to keep it as a gift
for a friend anyway.

Package came super fast - just in time for Christmas Eve even though it was a
last minute purchase. The system is pretty cool and has an insane amount of
games. Easy to figure out and they look great even on a small screen.
