The transaction and delivery were great. Very prompt with messaging, and items
were incredibly well packaged. I expected cosmetic defects due to it being
refurbished, but all I found was a very small scratch on the front which is
better than what I expected. The controllers are OK. Buttons are a bit clunky,
but they were cheap enough that I am happy with them. Overall, I would buy from
this seller again.

Came in the best condition possible, best would be still in the box. Best I
could find for a fair price, came in the mail safe and well packaged. Games load
a lot faster then my old one, which would take 30+ minutes to get it running.
The refurbished PS2 I bought from Voomwa loaded instantly and exceeded
expectations.

Overall great condition and fast shipping! One of the remotes, the back button
sticks really bad, but apart from that, I would highly recommend this seller.
Hard to find these older systems in the condition I received for the price.

All parts came looking almost brand new And the ship time was very fast. Got the
system installed and the console to the tv was saying that it could not read the
disc. I had my nephew bring his system over and we got the same issue on my new
one with his games and my games played on his old console. Got in touch with the
seller and they replaced the console and my games did play on the replacement.
They made it feel like a no problem, no hassle exchange Thank you Voomwa very
much

It came on time and came as advertised in the photo. I was disappointed that the
eject button was used a lot and the top of the player that opens for the PS2
system to play discs seemed to be warped. I really debated on for a little bit
on rather to return it for a replacement OR keep it. I didn't want to sound
picky so I decided to keep it. i am not sure if the warped opening was already
that way OR if the postal workers/deliveries did it. But I do know that the used
eject button came that way.

Man this was a great find! We’ve been meaning to get a PS2 for a while and
getting one with a warranty was the way to go. It works great, its so tiny
(takes up no space at all its crazy), and its a great deal since you get 2
wireless controllers and 2 sd cards. Seller was very helpful in the process,
would buy again!

Got it the same week I ordered it! I’ve already played a couple of games on it
and it works great, it’s as if the console just released looks and feels brand
new. If anything were to happen to the one I ordered I’d def only get it from
them again. If your looking for something they doesn’t have that used look to it
this is the place.

quality for the price and the look and feel are awesome. I would recommend this

it and so far no issues. BUY ONE FROM THEM.!!
