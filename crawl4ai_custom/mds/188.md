#### Works perfectly and allows me to play import games, but I wish I knew I
could buy it for cheaper.

I bought it so that I could play the Japanese exclusive game, "Garo: Golden
Knight," and it played the game perfectly, but I wish that Japanese PS2s were
available at cheaper prices to the US market.

#### New fan of the Playstation Japan console

This is my first ever purchasing a Japanese console and playing the games was
much better than the normal US format console when playing older games.

#### Highly Recommended

I highly recommend buying your games from A & C Games in Toronto, ON. They are
the best and I really love their fast shipment and cheap prices. You won't be
disappointed.
