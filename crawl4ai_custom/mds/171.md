I ordered the B grade for the 3DSLL and it was better than expected. The
scratches were only in the back and the screen wasn’t yellow one bit. For the
price it was a total steal and it was already modded! The console is beautiful
in person. The quality is comparable to slightly used. 10/10 would buy from
seller again because not only does he respond in a timely matter and was always
clear when communicating. Would shop with this vendor again!

the console came in amazing condition! there were only a few scratches on the
back and sides of the console but that's completely normal for a used console.
it works perfectly and also had homebrew pre-downloaded onto the 3ds xl ll which
made it super helpful for modding and customizing the console! it took only a
few days after the confirmation for shipping to arrive which was amazing and was
packaged very securely! 10/10 would recommend this seller if you are thinking
about it!

genuinely so happy to have purchased!! seller was so quick to reply back & i got
the Rank A 32gb LL in white. SO worth it. took approx 3 weeks between shipping
and delivery to get to me. came pre-loaded with homebrew, fbi, hshop and i was
easily able to add what i needed without removing the sd!! few scuffs to outer
shell & a scratch on the screen u genuinely can’t even notice unless held to the
light at an angle. some yellowing on the edges of the screens but undetectable
when in use! so happy!

arrived safely in the mail, console had some scratches but this didn't really
affect the overall quality to me as it still works perfectly fine. And the pink
colour of the console is very aesthetically pleasing, which really pleased me.
Great value for money considering how expensive nintendo 3ds xl's are, including
being modded too which was a great bonus as I was quite scared to mod the
console myself.

I’m blown away by this purchase. Not only is it affordable, but the quality and
condition of my DS is nearly pristine. Not only is there not a single scratch,
but it also comes with a charger, stylus, annnnd a 32G SD card inserted!! I love
it. The appearance is amazing, which is great because I ended up ordering a rank
A 3DS XL and I know the extra money spent was well worth it. The seller was also
very reliable and responded promptly to messages. I’m very happy with my
purchase :D

I LOVE IT SO MUCH. It shipped on the 10th day and came 3-4 days after. I got the
A ranked there were tiny scratches on the screen and 1 on the back which didn't
take away from the product. The seller communicated very well. The battery is a
little worn but is to be excepted, and no yellowing of the screen. I'm so
excited my childhood self is so freaking happy. I recommend decorating to cover
the small flaws. Also the pen is yellow from use but they are a few dollars of
amazon to buy a pack.

It’s so amazing!!!!! Although it took a month, it arrived just in the predicted
date and in perfect condition😇 once I turn it in and test it out, I’ll edit
this. But so far, it’s amazing! Thank you so much! I can’t wait to start
playing, mod it, put fun stickers on it, and take it everywhere I go :) it looks
very sleek and its good quality. Its value is incredible. I love it so much!

Order came within the time stated, I got just the aqua blue 3ds with no sd card
or charger. Seller kept me notified during the wait, and I didn’t feel like they
were ever sketchy. 3ds is in very good condition, (I got the A rank) the only
issue is that the circle pads rubber part fell off. But that can be easily
fixed. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend
this seller!

Perfectly described. Shipping was around 10 days to ship + 3 days to get to my
house. I ordered a xl LL in rank A, and there was scratches on the exterior but
basically pristine screen(s). buttons were a bit worn in but thats to be
expected. Absolutely transparent and effective communication with the seller.
Also came fully modded (homebrew, FBI, hshop). Overall amazing experience and I
highly recommend this seller. (ALSO, photos i posted are in perfect lighting,
scratches arent THAT apparent.)

Item arrived as advertised, well packed too. Got held up in customs for a while
since I guess for orders over $250 they're supposed to include your ssn in some
paperwork or something but honestly I'm fine keeping an eye on the tracking and
giving fedex my ssn myself for customs when the time comes rather than telling
it to someone over eBay lol so what can ya do. Buying through them again 👍

Perfectly described. Shipping was around 10 days to ship + 3 days to get to my
house. I ordered a xl LL in rank A, and there was scratches on the exterior but
basically pristine screen(s). buttons were a bit worn in but thats to be
expected. Absolutely transparent and effective communication with the seller.
Also came fully modded (homebrew, FBI, hshop). Overall amazing experience and I
highly recommend this seller. (ALSO, photos i posted are in perfect lighting,
scratches arent THAT apparent.)

Item arrived as advertised, well packed too. Got held up in customs for a while
since I guess for orders over $250 they're supposed to include your ssn in some
paperwork or something but honestly I'm fine keeping an eye on the tracking and
giving fedex my ssn myself for customs when the time comes rather than telling
it to someone over eBay lol so what can ya do. Buying through them again 👍
