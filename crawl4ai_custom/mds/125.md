As for the quality of the Ambernic, I give it a 10/10 and as for how far it has
come, I also give it a 9/10. When I play the Ambernic, it takes me back to my
childhood with PSP and Game Boy games, that's why I bought this console and its
appearance makes it practical and very comfortable and I can take it anywhere,
that's why I give it a 10/10 in everything.
