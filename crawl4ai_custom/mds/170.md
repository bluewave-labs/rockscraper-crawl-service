It works great! Packaging was done really well. I’m really pleased to get to
play the SNES again. Probably my favorite system. Condition was good overall.
You can’t be too picky with refurbished items. Little cosmetic issues but
nothing major. Highly recommend the seller!

Got this because my first SNES from when I was a kid wasn't working anymore.
Playing my old games was such a wonderful moment. The system works fine,
sometimes the screen is just a black screen but I think that's a cart issue,
these games are 30 plus years old now lol.

Fast shipping! The console arrived packaged so well and everything was clean.
The SNES works great although the after factory plug is a little loose which is
not surprising. I would absolutely buy from this seller again!

One of the controllers didn’t work but it was no big deal. The machine is almost
as old as I am. Can’t expect perfection. I would buy from this person again.

Item worked as advertised. Only issue was there was minimal damage to the back
corner. Still is better looking than most snes consoles sold on ebay since some
around this price range are yellow. Was packaged well to ensure that no damage
would happen to the console during shipping. Would buy again.

Do NOT buy this. Machine looks nothing like what was pictured. It didn't work
when it arrived. I had to tear it apart, clean it and repair it. Plastic is
busted inside where screws should be that hold it together. Thankfully I was
able to make it work so I'll keep it as an extra. If you are starting a retro
collection this is not the machine you are wanting.

This is my second purchase from Loot Hive, and I’ve been really happy. Items
have consistently arrived clean, well packaged, and as described. The microphone
had an unexpected manufacturing defect that prevented it from being plugged into
the gaming console. The seller was quickly responsive with a working replacement
and paid for return shipping. Highly recommend Loot Hive for your gaming needs!

Item shipped quickly, nicely packaged and as described. In fact, it exceeded my
expectations. The system and controller arrived spotlessly clean, not even a
smudge - and both look amazing. Everything works perfectly and appreciated the
set up instructions and brand new cables included. Considering the price, a
great deal for such an old system. Great transaction, A+++ seller.

Seller was very friendly! I had put the wrong address at first when making the
purchase originally, but they had refunded me and I was able to buy the item
shortly after with the correct address :) The item IS as described - fully
packaged and very nice. The stylus fits my 3DS XL which is so lovely as my old
one was starting to scratch the screen. and the shipping seemed really fast!
Thank you!
