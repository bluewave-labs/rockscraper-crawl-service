Came in great condition like it was basically brand new. Definitely worth the
price because it also had mods which saved me a lot of time. Very clean and no
cracks. The 2 little rubber pieces on the sides of top screen did start to fall
apart a little but not a big deal. Definitely recommend this seller. Good value
and great quality.

ARRIVED SO PERFECT THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!! I love it so much. I
genuinely played it the entire weekend and even brought it to school to play in
the mornings. I'm having so much fun and the shipping didn't even take long.
Everything works perfectly and there isn't a scratch. The battery life is
amazing. The price was so good and the device looks absolutely amazing. I'm so
glad I purchased from here. I've been eyeing nintendo 3ds xls for SO LONG NOW,
and I'm so glad I finally got one.

We purchased a "VG" 3ds and it's in very very good condition. Battery life is
good and the outer casing is clearly used but still in very good condition. The
Nintendo eshop is not accessible but they provide you with an hshop which has
tons of games available for download. Item shipped from Japan but was received
in about a week, quite impressive time for international shipping. Considering
that these things can sell for $250-300 still brand new this was definitely a
good value.

The item I ordered arrived in amazing condition. The console works perfectly,
all the buttons and displays function, the battery holds charge and there are
minimal scratches and scuffing on the console‚Äôs body; appearing exactly has the
seller described. Amazing pricing for this quality and condition.

I really like this. The quality is as good as the reviews say, theres no
scratches, no discoloring, no dead pixels. Downloading games has been very
simple but anything beyond that is not explained. Reddit has a lot of info about
modded 3ds‚Äôs for those who need it. The only issue I have is with the SD card
slot, it‚Äôs a little hard to open but it‚Äôs fine. Also for anyone buying this with
128 GB, it does take longer than usual for it to boot up but from what I‚Äôve seen
that is perfectly normal.

Originally ordered mint color but came with screen damage from travel, but
seller helped me refund easily and my replacement pink console is excellent!
Ordered ‚ÄòVG‚Äô and console has no visible damage. 2 small dead pixels on top
screen but not very noticeable while playing! Recommend this seller :)

Extremely pleased with my purchase! Great quality for the price being payed and
comes pre-modded. There is some noticeable yellowing on the bottom screen but
none that interferes with gameplay, and is not to be unexpected when buying G.
Outside is beautiful with no noticeable scratches or marks. Overall, very
pleased with my purchase!

Product quality is good. Comes as described. Time from order to label creation
was 2 weeks. Another few days before picked up by fedex. About 4 days to ship
and receive (during Xmas season) I did reach out to check status, response was
provided by action vs actual communication. They did reach out after it was
shipped and apologized for the delay. Recommend buy early and don‚Äôt rely on the
shipping est. Would buy from them again. Just be patient and it will get sent.
