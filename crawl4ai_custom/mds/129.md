Overall quality / condition is pristine. No issues so far. Console is
significantly lighter than I remember (not complaining). I am absolutely in love
with the color! Shipped on 1/03 and delivered on early morning of 1/7. Was able
to get it modded and running in under 30 minutes. Seller was quick to respond to
any questions I had. Also appreciate not having to purchase a charger, and an SD
card / adapter for it. Huge time saver. Overall the price I paid was well worth
it and would buy again. 5/5

Came similar to the pictured unit. I don't usually buy stuff like that but so
many people had good things to say about the seller. FYI if he told you to take
apart the front shell of the PSP, it's not a big deal. It's very simple and you
can make it pretty much spotless. I don't blame him at all for the small amounts
of dust that were there. Shipping wad simplr yet effective. Charger works well.
SD card seems good but I willl use it somewhere else. 10/10 Another good console
into the collection!

Items were so carefully wrapped and protected to keep from being damaged from
shipping. Everything was described perfectly and came in the exact quality
specified. It works wonderfully, the color was true to photos, and it‚Äôs been
amazing playing on this ‚Äúretro‚Äù console - though with me being 40, it‚Äôs not all
that ‚Äúretro‚Äù to me since I remember when this came out. It‚Äôs great to finally
own one, and my 16 year old is loving it as well!

One of the best purchases I have ever made here on Ebay! The seller was quick to
ship my PSP & it arrived in great timing. The PSP looks brand new / fresh out of
the box with only a few scratches here & there but it still looks amazing! The
console runs perfectly, reads UMD discs well, & the seller even left a nice note
in case anything happens to it. I most definitely see myself purchasing from
this seller again in the future!

I ordered a PSP 1000 device and am very satisfied with the quality of my
purchase. The condition was marked Used but the device I received is near mint.
Because of the this the overall appearance of the unit is almost like I got it
from the box in 2005. I think the device being in such great condition, the
guarantee of it working, everything working as it should on a PSP in 2025, and
coming with a memory card and battery makes this an excellent purchase.

Great handheld and brings back some good memories. I still have my original PSP
but it has some ware and tare, this one looks brand new and works amazingly! I
chose yellow and I love the way it pops. Looks like bumblebee! Great price for
what it comes with and the condition. Note even the UMD player works! I have
bought a PSPS off Etsy before and the UMDs don‚Äôt work in it. Will definitely
recommend and come back when I‚Äôm not broke
