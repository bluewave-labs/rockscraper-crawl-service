Very fast shipping. Overall good. Buttons and sticks are high quality. Screen is
super sharp. Games play well, no instructions on how to run games so I had to
figure it out. Most of the games on 256gb sd card are not in English, but it‚Äôs
easy to just download the USA version of the roms and replace them.

My item came quick and arrived exactly as advertised. I've bought a few devices
from Anbernic and they always do a great job. The RG406H is my favorite device
so far and would recommend it to anyone who thinks they're interested in it. For
me, I wanted a 4-inch device that can play 4:3 content well and this checked all
of the boxes.
