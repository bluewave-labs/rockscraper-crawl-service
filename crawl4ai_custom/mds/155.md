Good seller! Xbox works perfectly and is in great condition. Only thing I will
say though is the power brick and cable that came with it isn't OEM, and the
backing holding the batteries for the controller was also not OEM. Console
though is perfectly fine, think they used a different shell than what the xbox
360 originally came with because my other one has a glossy finish, but this
different shell actually feels better than my other one. Overall, no problems!

Great seller and amazing products. I purchased a refurbished Xbox 360. It's in
beautiful condition with everything original included. I'm so happy! The
refinishing is perfect and the system is in excellent condition as specified. I
will be going to this seller for all refurbished consoles in the future. Very
professional and trustworthy.

Excellent condition, arrived on time, packaged with good padding, nothing
damaged. Tested it and works like new! Only wish the HDMI cable included was a
little longer. Although I will be keeping this seller in mind if I want to buy
more games in the future.

The console works great straight out of the package. No wears or tears in terms

Would recommend seller and hope to buy again in the future.

Shipped fast and packaged well all parts wrapped in bubble wrap and a foam block
for the console and the controller was in superb condition. The console itself
was in excellent condition no issues. The hard drive is a 250gb but is not a
official one which is to be expected with buying refurbished Xbox 360s but they
are not expensive to get hold of if you want a official one. The one that was
installed does work and is in good condition so not a complaint. All in all was
in great condition.

The console came spotless. Beautiful condition. My only complaint is that the

Other than that I‚Äôm really satisfied with this seller.

Item shipped quickly, nicely packaged and as described. In fact, it exceeded my
