The PSP came in great condition. There are hardly any visible scratches on the
body, and no scratches on the screen. It came in great packaging, preserving the
good quality of the PSP. Upon first booting up, the disc drive made loud
scratching sounds, but once a UMD disc was put in, it was fine. The games run as
best as they can, and everything works as expected. Great value for the
condition it came in. It took a full 10 days to ship, but arrived quickly. I
recommend this seller to others.

The quality of the PSP is excellent for an old system the condition it was
shipped in was MINT!!! For such an old system in this incredible condition the
value was incredible! I’ve already registered it and began playing games and if
I wish watch videos. Again the appearance is simply beautiful and the
communication with the seller was top notch coming from Japan. Shipping took
awhile but that was already documented in a previous review so no worries. Great
item and fantastic seller.

The PSP 3000 came in amazing condition. Looks extremely brand new and the color
is gorgeous. (I got Pink) The charger that it came with works excellent. I was
able to Mod the portable and update to the latest version 6.61 with no problem.
I’m already downloading games & music on it and it works great! No problems at
all! Definitely will buy from this User again when I get another PSP!

Incredible to purchase such an old console for only $110 and receive this!
Everything works great, include the disk drive. There is a bit of screen
yellowing, which was described as a possibility and is to be expected, so I’m
fine with it. It took 14 days for the item to be shipped, but it was delivered
only 2 days after! Would recommend.

Came in perfection condition. No scratches or dings or dents. For anyone
ordering one of these psp's you might have to reset to default settings. The one
that came to me still needs to be reset. Has old persons name and a pass code
attached to system. Other then that, it's great. Nicely charged with battery
pack installed.

The PSP came in very good condition for how old of a system it is. It had some
scratches on the shell, minimal paint chipping, no scratches on the screen, and
barely any screen yellowing. It came with the three games, charger, and a new
battery as described. The seller had very good communication. It was delivered
fast once it was shipped. Overall I’m very satisfied with my purchase and I
would buy from and recommend this seller to someone else.

PSP came in pretty good condition considering it’s used. UMDs work fine, the
memory stick works. The only issue is that the disc drives makes a screeching
noise when a UMD is in it but I haven’t seen it affect the games so far. Apart
from the disc drive, the PSP works as intended. The charger cable included also
works fine.

OK so im normally weary of ordering from eBay but this was good! Fully
functional, buttons are responsive, charges just fine (it’s the dc charger not
the android one)., and the speakers work GREAT. The ONLY complaint I have is
that it took 2 weeks before the seller even shipped it. Listing says 11 days max
but this took more than that. Also 2 out of 3 of the games that were sent are
region-locked(I think) and we can’t play them on this device. Looks good though

The system is in perfect condition. Took a while to ship, but arrived faster
than anything else I’ve ordered once it did ship. The packaging did make me a
little nervous, as there wasn’t as much padding as I’d have liked, but there
were no scratches or damage when it arrived. I saw some other reviews mentioning
this, but please note that the DESCRIPTION of the listing clarified that the
games included are Japanese. No parts missing, excellent value, beautiful
system. Will use seller again.

seller replied quickly and was helpful. customer service was awesome. shipping
was also crazy fast after the wait (it was about a week) as it only took a day
to get to me. the plates themselves are in OK condition. they are nintendo
branded so the quality is great. i was expecting them to be cleaner because of
the price. then again it is listed as used. you can barely tell because of the
case i have on anyway. looks great on my console regardless!

Shipping did take a bit long but once the product us out there, it arrives to
your location very fast. It took at least 3 days after it was shipped. The
seller was also generous to contact me regarding the 4GB storage card was out of
stock and substitute it with a 8GB card without any additional charges. The
console came is very clean conditioning it was packaged well. I had no problems
using the device and it feels like new for the price I paid for.

The package look around 10 days to be shipped, but the shipping time it’s self
was only about 4 days (with delayed weather)!! It was packaged quite well. The
description says used but there are only minor scratches on the cover plates and
no dents or discoloration! I was happy to see the back plate came with screws.
Overall, I’m really happy with it, even though it was $40. Somehow you can’t
find these pink ones cheaper. Anyways, I love it!

The Psp Vita came in perfect condition. Everything turns on well and works
properly (sound, lighting, colours, movement, buttons) and there are no
scratches anywhere. Shipped around 11 days after purchasing, and covered in
protective packaging to ensure smooth delivery. Also had great communication
with shipper. Definitely had some issues with delivery but that was mainly at
fault of UPS delays (psp came 2 weeks late 😣), but other than that I would
definitely purchase from this seller again!

The system works & looks amazing. Been using it nonstop since I got it. Very
accurate to what's said about getting the system & 3 games. Packaged well.
Though it did take a while for the PSP to arrive, the seller was great with
communication & just overall great experience. I would do business with this
seller again!

The package look around 10 days to be shipped, but the shipping time it’s self
was only about 4 days (with delayed weather)!! It was packaged quite well. The
description says used but there are only minor scratches on the cover plates and
no dents or discoloration! I was happy to see the back plate came with screws.
Overall, I’m really happy with it, even though it was $40. Somehow you can’t
find these pink ones cheaper. Anyways, I love it!

The Psp Vita came in perfect condition. Everything turns on well and works
properly (sound, lighting, colours, movement, buttons) and there are no
scratches anywhere. Shipped around 11 days after purchasing, and covered in
protective packaging to ensure smooth delivery. Also had great communication
with shipper. Definitely had some issues with delivery but that was mainly at
fault of UPS delays (psp came 2 weeks late 😣), but other than that I would
definitely purchase from this seller again!

The system works & looks amazing. Been using it nonstop since I got it. Very
accurate to what's said about getting the system & 3 games. Packaged well.
Though it did take a while for the PSP to arrive, the seller was great with
communication & just overall great experience. I would do business with this
seller again!
