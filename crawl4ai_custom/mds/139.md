The quality was perfect, and it arrived really fast, despite the holiday season.
The device was a bit dirty, but the buttons are in perfect condition. No
scratches on the screen, either. I feel like I got a really good item for the
price. Appearance wise, it's gorgeous. I felt like I was 13 again, unwrapping
the 3ds I begged my mom for. Definitely cried, would order again from this
seller.

The 3DS arrived on time and it looks amazing! It looks almost mint with the only
imperfections being some dirt on the joystick and a couple scratches on the
bottom of the shell, but the console itself works and thats all I need. As for
the CFW, I have experience modding DSs so the existing CFW isn't a problem for
me. Super happy to add another DS to my growing collection, would buy from this
seller again.

The item arrived in perfect condition, Although it was a Japanese version; It
really made no difference I was able to alter it so it has those apps on there
and manage save files for all my pokemon games so I still have my old progress
but could replay the story. The price wasn't too bad compared to others I've
seen. Also, the look of it was slick and clean (I got the black regular 3ds
console) overall it was a good quality purchase and I'd recommend buying your
retro consoles from these guys :)

The 3DS came in excellent condition. It may as well have been brand new. There
wasn't any scratches or scuffs on the device or it's screens. Everything
functioned as expected, with no issues. The 3DS was also packaged well. The 64GB
SD card is an excellent upgrade to the default 4GB ones that Nintendo included
with the 3DSs.

The package did come quickly. Nothing was missing and the ds looks almost brand
new other than some minor scratches. The tip of the stylus pen was chewed up but
they have it on Amazon for $3 so I’m not complaining about that. I’m pretty sure
it’s Japan region though because I’m trying to update some games and it won’t
let me because it’s not in the correct region which kinda sucks but the games do
work well!

The 3DS arrived in great condition, it had a few scratches and a few marks but
nothing a wipe and some disinfecting alcohol can’t take away so appearance wise
it’s perfect! I think the value I get for the price is great so, I’m very happy
with the quality of it!

Shipping time on this purchase was fantastic. Everything came as described and
in good condition. Great deal for a 3DS and an SD together. I was honestly
expecting more wear on the device itself but it came almost pristine with just
some yellowing on the joystick and stylus, which is fine since they're only
cosmetic.

i ordered a psp from this seller before , and it came in perfectly clean .
however , when my 3ds showed up , it didn't look like it had been cleaned at all
(smudges on the screen , fuzz flew out of the stylus slot when i took it out,
etc) . they also did not mention they modded the 3ds already , which would've
really messed me up if i didn't know what i was doing . regardless , the 3ds
still works , so i can't complain . thanks !

The Joy Cons arrived in perfect as new condition just as advertised. These are
OEM refurb Joy Cons and are in perfect OEM quality just minus the OEM packaging.
If you don't care about the original boxes these are a great value over buying
new. They shipped next day and if it weren't for USPS misrouting my package all
the way across the country they would have arrived just 3 days after ordering.

Wow, I am very impressed with the process I had while purchasing this. The
seller immediately shipped out the product, as detailed (and actually better
than that). The seller was prompt, efficient, and packaged my PSP efficiently.
The quality that went into packaging and shipping the PSP were excellent, too.
The appearance of the device is also quite remarkable, as it looks like it was
hardly used (if at all). The price that I paid was good, too.

The console arrived quickly and as described. The console was very well
packaged. There are a few scratches on the bottom screen as well as quite a few
minor cracks on the top case of the console (which may have occurred during

itself takes a long time to turn on but it still works as intended. Overall,
this is a really great seller and I definitely recommend purchasing from them.

I recently purchased a PSP 3000 from The Gaming Archive, and I couldn't be
happier with my choice! The PSP arrived in excellent condition, complete with a
new battery and charger, just as advertised. The shipping was impressively fast,
which is always a major plus, and the packaging was secure. As a first-time PSP
owner, I learned that a memory stick duo (SD card for the PSP) is necessary, so
keep that in mind. Overall, my experience has been fantastic, and I recommend

I asked a question before I bought these and the seller got back to me pretty
quickly. I went ahead and bought a pair and they arrived way faster than I
expected. They were packed well and looked brand new. I'm super happy with my
