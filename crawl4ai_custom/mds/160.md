Item shipped quickly, nicely packaged and as described. In fact, it exceeded my
expectations. The system and controller arrived spotlessly clean, not even a
smudge - and both look amazing. Everything works perfectly and appreciated the
set up instructions and brand new cables included. Considering the price, a
great deal for such an old system. Great transaction, A+++ seller.

Its amazing. Never seen a xbox in such great condition. It looks brand new. They
added a matte skin to the console to get rid of scratches. The controller was
literally new. I bought the black Xbox 360 E and it's amazing!! Even though it's
a bit spendy, it's worth the price all the way. The color matches perfect with
the skin. Overall amazing qaulity will definitely be coming back. Best
refurbishment store. Please support this business and keep them going because
they actually care unlike others

The quality was super good, I really was surprised when I got it out of the box

truely the best. Appearance and condition were also really good. Booted up
instantly no issues at all. I highly recommend!

So far so good. Looks clean and seem to be working well for an older console.
Refurbished item, little pricy for how old it is but I've been having bad luck
at gameshops so wanted to test it out with it being refurbished.

It works, the consoles in great shape. The controller up dpad button is iffy and
the controller in general did not look cleaned. The hdmi cable that it comes
with is 2 ft. At this price I definitely would've expected a pristine controller
and at least a 6ft cable... but I will leave it as positive because ive managed
to play through 3 games now with no issues and the console it's was practically
pristine and another controller is only like 20 us bucks. No photos I've already
releaned everything.
