WOW. Listing said it was in good condition, but I would describe it as mint. No
major scratches (none on either ips screen… amazing), I got white (which tends
to discolor) and it was in excellent condition. OEM shell as well, not a cheap
3rd party replacement. He answered my questions very kindly and thoroughly, so
glad I bought from this seller. Shipped quick and packaged well. A+++++ seller,
truly a wonderful experience

Came in on time and as described. The price was definitely a little more than
average but worth it to get from a reputable seller. Everything was packaged
neatly and secure. Would recommend this seller to others looking for
reliability.

RetroReloadNYC is a fantastic eBay seller. The WAP-002 AC adapter arrived
quickly (fast shipping!) and was packaged well. Most importantly, it's a genuine
OEM Nintendo charger – no cheap knockoff here! I highly recommend this seller to
any 3DS/3DS XL owner. Excellent communication too!

Not the sellers fault at all but I just want to point out that it took nearly 3
weeks longer than the expected date for my item to arrive. USPS is so archaic
it's laughable. The seller was really cooperative, communicative and apologetic
regarding the shipping. Besides the delivery, the 3DS arrived with great
packaging. The description of the 3DS was accurate, minor scratches but every
other aspect was good. Price was more than fair and I'm overall satisfied with
the product and the seller.

Item is in perfect condition, like new. Fits the VG description, and I have to
admit I am very impressed. Seller shipped next day and the packaging was more
than sufficient via usps. My only complaint is decision fatigue with choices of
color, but extremely happy with my selection. I did not have any communication
with the seller, however after closer review of their shop, I’m happy I want
with this seller and they have a solid record. Will buy again soon.

Great experience with this seller! The 3DS was exactly as described. Excellent
condition. My wife thought it was new. Purchased on Monday received it Friday!
There was one accessory that was missing when received, but I contacted the
seller and they took car of it immediately and shipped out the missing
accessory! Thank you again! You are the type of seller that makes eBay a great
place to shop! My daughter is gonna love having a teal 3DS perfect Christmas
