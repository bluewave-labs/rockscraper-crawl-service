Seller was 100% honest in the description. The device works completely, but
there are cosmetic issues. Just minor scratches on the screen and body of the
console. I'm very pleased for the quality of the item for the price range. Both
ports work, charges fine, and screen has minor tracking issues but I'm pretty
sure i remember the same issue from the brand new one i had as a kid. Overall a
great purchase.

It works like a dream, is in great shape, a few cosmetic scratches, but overall
not a problem, if anything it looks like how my original metallic pink ds lite
looked, lol, it was delivered quickly and in protected packing, thank you so
much! I’ll be spending hours/days replaying a ton of games!

For such a old system now, came in great condition and is in good quality.
System has minor scuffs as to be expected for the appearance but paint job is
great and the screens are very bright.

The item is in great condition with not major blemishes nor any damage.
Furthermore, it was at a reasonable price and allows one to play games from both
the Gameboy Advanced and DS. Also, the black color makes it less prone to
staining.

Item in great condition, feels almost new! There is a few scratches on the shell
and the bottom screen is somewhat yellowed, but overall is in WAY better
condition than the vast majority of DS Lites in 2025. Opening up a DS for
repairs is such a pain so it is nice to get one that just feels right.

The DS Lite is in perfect condition, as one can expect from this seller. Yes, it
is refurbished but feels so polished and clean. I’m so excited to be able to
play my GBA games as well as my DS games. Childhood commence!

All around great quality! Quick delivery. Good packaging. The shell and buttons
look and feel like new. Both screens have a bit of yellowing, but you hardly
notice it when playing. Thanks!

The Joy Cons arrived in perfect as new condition just as advertised. These are
OEM refurb Joy Cons and are in perfect OEM quality just minus the OEM packaging.
If you don't care about the original boxes these are a great value over buying
new. They shipped next day and if it weren't for USPS misrouting my package all
the way across the country they would have arrived just 3 days after ordering.

Wow, I am very impressed with the process I had while purchasing this. The
seller immediately shipped out the product, as detailed (and actually better
than that). The seller was prompt, efficient, and packaged my PSP efficiently.
The quality that went into packaging and shipping the PSP were excellent, too.
The appearance of the device is also quite remarkable, as it looks like it was
hardly used (if at all). The price that I paid was good, too.

The console arrived quickly and as described. The console was very well
packaged. There are a few scratches on the bottom screen as well as quite a few
minor cracks on the top case of the console (which may have occurred during
shipping, I’m not sure) but it looks almost brand new otherwise! The console
itself takes a long time to turn on but it still works as intended. Overall,
this is a really great seller and I definitely recommend purchasing from them.

I recently purchased a PSP 3000 from The Gaming Archive, and I couldn't be
happier with my choice! The PSP arrived in excellent condition, complete with a
new battery and charger, just as advertised. The shipping was impressively fast,
which is always a major plus, and the packaging was secure. As a first-time PSP
owner, I learned that a memory stick duo (SD card for the PSP) is necessary, so
keep that in mind. Overall, my experience has been fantastic, and I recommend
shopping with TGA

I asked a question before I bought these and the seller got back to me pretty
quickly. I went ahead and bought a pair and they arrived way faster than I
expected. They were packed well and looked brand new. I'm super happy with my
new Joy Cons, and they're so nice in white. Would totally buy from this seller
again. 10/10
