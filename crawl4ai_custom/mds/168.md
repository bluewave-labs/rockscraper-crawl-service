Wii is in full working condition! Awesome price for the bundle. Everything looks
clean and brand new. However, the bundle comes with third party controllers. It
is not stated in the description that they are third party and the accuracy on
them seems to be worse than oem, but still playable. Overall everything is
amazing and would buy from this store again.

Great items and in working condition! Still has plastic on the controllers which
makes it look brand new which is awesome! Unfortunately the system must've been
cracked in postage care but still works great! Other than that, condition was
great and works great!

The Wii Gaming System and accessories were in very good condition. After I
discovered the system would only work by connecting it to the TV's AV connection
and not the HDMI connection (TV screen kept flickering in and out), I was very
satisfied with it's operation. I tested my girl friend's using HDMI, and it
worked just fine. Not being able to use HDMI was not deal breaker for me as my
TV had an AV connection.

This is my second purchase from Loot Hive, and I’ve been really happy. Items
have consistently arrived clean, well packaged, and as described. The microphone
had an unexpected manufacturing defect that prevented it from being plugged into
the gaming console. The seller was quickly responsive with a working replacement
and paid for return shipping. Highly recommend Loot Hive for your gaming needs!

Item shipped quickly, nicely packaged and as described. In fact, it exceeded my
expectations. The system and controller arrived spotlessly clean, not even a
smudge - and both look amazing. Everything works perfectly and appreciated the
set up instructions and brand new cables included. Considering the price, a
great deal for such an old system. Great transaction, A+++ seller.

Seller was very friendly! I had put the wrong address at first when making the
purchase originally, but they had refunded me and I was able to buy the item
shortly after with the correct address :) The item IS as described - fully
packaged and very nice. The stylus fits my 3DS XL which is so lovely as my old
