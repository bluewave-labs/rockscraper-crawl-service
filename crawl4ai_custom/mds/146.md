I was amazed at how pristine the council and remotes are. It has worked
flawlessly since I purchased it a few weeks ago. I highly recommend this seller
and this Wii bundle if you’re in the market for a some throwback gameplay. In my
opinion it’s a great price for the great quality you get from this seller. So
clean it appears brand new. Packed quite safely for shipping as well.

I bought the Wii that came with HDMI, 4 remotes & nunchucks, Wii sports, and Wii
play. Shipping was fast, the Wii and the remotes work great, no issues there.
The Wii play disc worked perfectly, the only issue I had was that the Wii sports
disc didn't work. I contacted the seller and they promptly responded and
provided me with a replacement disc that works as intended. Great product, great
seller, great value for money. Very happy with my purchase.

Fast shipping, great packaging. Everything was nice and secured in the box.
Console is in great condition, minimal scratches/damage to exterior of console.
Everything works as intended. Minor complaints; the cover for the GameCube
controller ports is very loose, doesn’t stay shut, the console didn’t come with
a stand and I received off brand controllers that don’t work with a homebrewed
Wii, so I had to purchase new ones anyways.

Wii came in excellent condition. There are surprisingly no marks on the console,
and everything looks clean. All parts listed in my purchase were received, and
all of the components work great. For how cheap they are able to sell them, they
offer a very good value here. Very satisfied with this product!

The Wii worked extremely well and showed nearly no signs of any wear on itself
and it’s components. The fact that it came with a hdmi adapter was a god send
because I personally forgot that Wiis used wires. The controllers were really my
only gripe but honestly I don know if it was because the hardware was iffy or if
the seller gave me faulty ones but I highly doubt that considering everything
else was high quality. For the cost it is well worth it.
