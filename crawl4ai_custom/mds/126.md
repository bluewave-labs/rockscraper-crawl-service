Really good for a refurbished PS5. I was a little skeptical at first but these
other reviews helped out more and made it confident in purchasing. Definitely if
you’re looking into getting one from here, would really recommend buying it.
Everything functions as it should and quality is good as well. Has a few minor
scratches but nothing too crazy. For the price as well definitely could save you
that extra $100-$150

So far so good. So happy to FINALLY have a Ps5. I'm currently installing some
apps and games and the controller and console work great so far. I haven't
tested the Fortnite code yet so I'm update my review if anything goes wrong. :)

Item was new as described. And was in new and perfect condition. Shipping was
delayed but good communication from seller and item arrived just 1 day late
which was acceptable. I was happy with communication and accuracy of listing.
Quality of the item was good. Appearance of item on listing was correct. Well
packed in shipping bag. Price and value was good. I would buy from this seller
again. There are some negative reviews for this seller but my experience was
good.

The product was excellently priced and sealed/new as advertised. The seller was
very understanding and prompt in their responses. I would happily work with the
seller again however, through no fault of the seller, the item was shipped via
FedEx and they have to be the single worst shipping company I have experienced.
I will spare the details but buyers be aware that if your item is shipped with
FedEx and you aren't home in the middle of the workday, you will struggle to get
your package.
