The item was packed like new and shipping was super fast (very impressive)! The
item almost looked brand new! The seller has great communication in English and
is a very nice person to talk to. I highly recommend this seller and they will
be first on my list for any of my retro gaming needs. I highly recommend looking
at their store before you buy, they have many other items that you may be
interested in and even some very rare Japanese game titles that are hard to find
in the US.

127 years at the same time. Super friendly seller sent updates and I appreciated
