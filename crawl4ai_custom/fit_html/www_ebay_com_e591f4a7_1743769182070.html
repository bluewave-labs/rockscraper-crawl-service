<h2>What can gift cards be used for?</h2>
<p>
  eBay gift cards can be used to buy almost anything on eBay.com. They may not
  be used to buy other eBay gift cards, third party gift cards, gift
  certificates, coupons, coins, paper money, virtual currency, or items
  generally considered to be "bullion" (for example, gold, silver, and other
  precious metals in the form of coins, bars, or ingots).  Not refundable or
  redeemable for cash unless required by law.  Items purchased with eBay Gift
  Cards must be shipped to the U.S.  Full terms and conditions apply.
