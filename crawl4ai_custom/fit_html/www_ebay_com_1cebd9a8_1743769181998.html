We restrict items that violate any laws, or infringe on intellectual property.</div></details></li><li><details><summary><span>How do I create an account?</span></summary><div>To get started, select List an item. We’ll help you create and verify your account, and set-up payment information during your first listing. Have your preferred payment account details on hand and be ready to receive a call or text on your phone for verification.</div></details></li><li><details><summary><span>When will I get paid?</span></summary><div>After we confirm the buyer's payment has been received, payouts are sent directly to your bank account, Monday through Friday (excluding bank holidays), within two business days. Once a payout is initiated, funds are typically available within 1-3 business days depending on your bank's normal processing time.</div></details></li><li><details><summary><span>Do I have to pay federal income tax on my sales?</span></summary><div>For tax year 2023, IRS regulations require all businesses that process payments, including online marketplaces like eBay, to issue a Form 1099-K for all sellers whose gross payments exceed the current reporting threshold of $20,000 and 200 transactions. However, just because you receive a 1099-K doesn’t automatically mean that you’ll owe taxes on the amount reported on your 1099-K. Form 1099-K reports proceeds (the total amount made from sales regardless of whether you made a profit or a loss). You will need to determine what amount, if any, reported on Form 1099-K represents income to be declared on your tax return. Generally, you don’t have to pay taxes on the sale of a personal item that was sold at a loss (you sold the item for less than what you paid for it). For example, if you bought a bike for $1,000 last year, and then sold it on eBay today for $700, that $700 you made would generally not be subject to income tax.
